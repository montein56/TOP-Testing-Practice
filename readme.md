    A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

    A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

    A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
